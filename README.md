# Colonel
Petri dish colony segmenter and counter in Python. Have you tried to install published tools and failed? Maybe this one will work!

It's not very fancy. There is no neural network, just basic functions. 

## Dependencies
* pyqt5 (pyqt5 on Pip)
* sci-kit image (scikit-image on Pip)
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

## Installation
There is no installation, just run `run.py` in the repo. Parameters can be adjusted in the `par.py` module.
